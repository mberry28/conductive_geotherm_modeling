Data and codes used in Berry et al., 2019 'Cold, wet roots of high elevation in the western United States', Nature (Submitted)

Column order:

Long, Lat, heat flow (mW/m3), Pn-derived Moho temperature (C) (Schutt et al 2018), Crustal Thickness (km) (Lowry and Perez Gussinye 2011),  Surface Temp (C), Mantle Potential Temp (C) (Schmandt and Lin, 2018), Surface Heat production (muW/m2)


Note that Surface heat production used aerogamma spectra and only reasonably accounts for the upper few meters of earth and was not used for the final conclusions of the Berry et al.
